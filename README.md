My learning was focused on making a straight forward portfolio that can answer all the main questions a user visiting it would have along with an interesting look.

## Optimizations

When I improve this project I would like to add a dark mode.

## Lessons Learned:

The template that I used for this portfolio had some messy css and scss that was a bit challenging to adjust to my preferences. I know in future projects to make organization a top priority and to reduce redundant code.
